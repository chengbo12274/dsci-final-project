# dsci-final-project
I submit my player csv database that be used in final project. and 5 steps of the project.
Step 5 is the complete whole project for mark.
And for the step 2, i want to submit the title and introduction and methods parts, and I do not know why it can not show on GitHub, since i get ready for other 4 steps, hope this is not a big deal.
